  This will be a connect 4 game with the capability to be pvp and pvc.<br>
  Starting with a 2d array I will create a board and with this board with 0, 1, 2 for empty, red, and yellow, in that order.<br>
  2d grid where it will be printed with the array in it's normal form so that it looks like a grid. <br>
  Pick a column it will check from the bottom till the top till it finds an empty spot and then it will place the selected color in the spot right above it. <br>
  after they place a piece it will check for a 4 in a row from the placed spot in all directions It will check the left, bottom, top left, and bottom left. If the slot right next to it isn't the same as the color it will go in the opposite direction of the selected direction. It will count the number of colors in that direction on both sides and if it ever reaches 4 or above because the check will be after for effiency, you win. <br>
