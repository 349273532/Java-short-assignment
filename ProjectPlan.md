This will be a connect 4 game with the capability to be pvp and pvc.<br>
Starting with a 2d array I will create a board and with this board with 0, 1, 2 for empty, red, and yellow, in that order.<br>
We will start with the game being played on a 2d grid where it will be printed with the array in it's normal form so that it looks like a grid. <br>
